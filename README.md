# Waiting State

A small, emotion-driven loading micro-interaction for web pages,
designed to reflect how users feel during slow or unstable network conditions.

## What this project is
This is a lightweight frontend experiment that explores how subtle animations
and emoji-based feedback can make waiting feel more human during loading states.

The loader combines:
- Letter-based loading animation
- Emotion-changing emoji sequence
- Pulse animation

All built using a single HTML file.

This project focuses purely on micro-interaction design and UX exploration.

## Why this exists
I’m currently exploring frontend development and UI/UX concepts.
This project is a quick experiment to understand how animation timing
and emotional feedback can improve perceived waiting experience.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS animations
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How to use
Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
